\section{External connectors}


\section{Interfaces}

The internal interfaces are the EPS, OBDH, TTC and "Payload 1" made by 6 pin Picoblade headers
positioned inside the 2U structure.

The pin assigment of each Picoblade is mirroed to match the correponding mating header on each module.

Specially for the EPS, two 4 pin Picoblades are used for interfacing the Charge and RBF headers 
on the module.

\section{PCB layout}

The PCB design uses two layer configuration with two ground planes for mechanical and thermal
balancing. 

Direct contact on power polygons and GND connections was opted for better current
flow and lesser heating on the copper traces.

Three fiducials are placed in each board variants for component machinery fiting if needed. 
While the boards that don't have many many SMD components like N1 and N2, the fiducials were
also placed for flexibilty in PCB manufacturing.
